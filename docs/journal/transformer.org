* masking current step in self-attention

the current step almost always gets the highest attention weight,
but it is not necessary to consider itself since the residual connection will add itself back anyways.
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02281][gu et al. (2018)]] suggested masking current steps.
on the other hand, if the other steps offer no valuable info, current step should simply trust in itself.

empirically i found that the mask is useful.
the model does not learn as fast without the mask.

however when causal mask is present to enforce the autoregressive structure,
adding this mask means that the first and the last steps have nothing to attend to,
which results in nans.

consider these two alternatives.
- =padbos=: pad additional bos symbols to the input sequence,
  sacrifice (slice off) one bos at each self-attention layer when providing the attention queries.
- =padnil=: pad one initial step for the attention values, similar to causal convolution.

=padbos= is slightly messier to implement, however both alternatives are as efficient as the original =nomask=.
all three performs similarly, with =padnil= slightly better ([[https://github.com/ysmiraak/eti/tree/master/docs/stats/decoder-current-step-mask.acc.csv][stats]] per 250 updates).

* complexity

| b | 128 | bottleneck dimension |
| d | 512 | model dimension      |
| t |  64 | time steps           |

ignoring minor costs:
split, stack, scaling, masking, softmax, relu, residual connection, normalization, gain, and various biases;
which all at most have \(O(d)\) parameters and \(O(dt)\) complexity.
