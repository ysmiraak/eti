* trial

** n

without masking current step

if the other steps offer no valuable info,
current step should simply trust in itself.

may be the cause for indecisiveness of middle steps?

* todo

** use the data on the server

~/data/wmt/de-en

update data pipeline

move path related stuff from `trial` to `util_io`

** try use emb_pos as position encoding

probably doesn't make sense
but it may help coordinating tgt and src

** try without dropout on emb_pos

when and where should we apply dropout?

** try convolution instead of self-attention

or both
