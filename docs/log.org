* idea

- 5 germanic languages : en da de sv nl
- parallel corpora between en and the other 4

training

- model 0: between en and nl
- model 1: between en and da de sv
- model 2: between en and nl, from model 1
- model 3: between en and nl, from model 1, train embedding only

evaluation

- bleu scores between en da de sv     ; for model 1
- bleu scores between nl and da de sv ; for model 2 3
- bleu scores between en and nl       ; for model 0 2 3

* data

- sentencepiece unigram vocabulary model, one for each lang
- remove pairs with sentences longer than 64 pieces

number of instances in each corpus

| lang |     raw | cleaned |
|------+---------+---------|
| da   | 1968800 | 1829268 |
| de   | 1920209 | 1769992 |
| sv   | 1862234 | 1746479 |
| nl   | 1997775 | 1842970 |

- consider instances with the same english translation
- ignore duplicate instances
- 1275006 shared unique instances
- randomly split 4096 instances for evaluation

for model 1

- randomly split 1024 instances from each corpus for validation
- 1024 * 3 * 2 = 6144 validation instances in total

for model 0 2 3

- randomly split 2048 instances from nl for validation
- 2048 * 2 = 4096 validation instances in total
