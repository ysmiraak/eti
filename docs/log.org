* todo

** try word dropout

randomly swap embeded target with embedded position

with an increasing swap rate

** try use emb_pos as position encoding

probably doesn't make sense
but it may help coordinating tgt and src

** try without dropout on emb_pos

when and where should we apply dropout?

** try convolution with self-attention
